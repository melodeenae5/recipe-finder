# Recipe Finder

## Description

My project is called Recipe Finder. It is a site where people can find many recipes more easily. Users can search recipes using the search bar or by clicking any of the category buttons. Each search will display 100 results. Users can then choose a recipe to see ingredients, diet & health labels, calories per serving, and a link to the recipe page where the full details and instructions are located.
